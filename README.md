# PP3-HANGMAN

PP3-HANGMAN is a Python terminal game, which runs on the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. Hang-Hangman is a traditional word guessing game.
The user will be given the game rules and a level choice to play the game at Easy or Hard.
The user can try to guess the word by guessing letters, if the letter is wrong a visual of the traditional hangman man will start to display. If the letter is in the word the letter is shown and another guess can be made until either the word gets completed or the user runs out of lives.
The game is for everyone that need a break from real life to collect their thoughts.


* The game can be found [here](https://pp3-hangthe-man.herokuapp.com/).
