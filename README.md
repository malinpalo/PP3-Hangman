# PP3-HANGMAN

PP3-HANGMAN is a Python terminal game, which runs on the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. Hang-Hangman is a traditional word guessing game.
The user will be given the game rules and a level choice to play the game at Easy or Hard.
The user can try to guess the word by guessing letters, if the letter is wrong a visual of the traditional hangman man will start to display. If the letter is in the word the letter is shown and another guess can be made until either the word gets completed or the user runs out of lives.
The game is for everyone that need a break from real life to collect their thoughts.


* The game can be found [here](https://pp3-hangthe-man.herokuapp.com/).

# Planning Of Hang-Hangman

* When Planning what I thought about and wanted in the game.

  + The user to see and be able to do .
  + The user not to be able to see but the program to do .
  + The game to be easy to use have easy to folow instructions with a logical flow to the  game.
  + I wanted the game to give feed back to the user if the instructions where not followed correctly or if incorrect information was input by accident.
  + I wanted the game to have a bit of color to it to give it a more fun look and to show with the colours instuctions , correct input and incorrect input.
